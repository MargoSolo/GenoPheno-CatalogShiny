# geno-pheno-CatalogShiny

`geno-pheno-Catalog-shiny` is an R Shiny app develop to provide a dynamic online catalog with datasets contaning both, genomic sequencing data and clinical data for the same patients. 

## What is this repository for?

The `geno-pheno-Catalog-shiny` R Shiny app provides a catalog, containing the country where the data was collected, the number of patients present in the dataset, the number of samples collected, the type of phenotypic data (electronic health records -EHR-, questionnaires, clinical notes), the type of genomic data (NGS, whole genome sequencing data -WGS -, whole exome sequencing data -WES- ) and the disease focus (general or disease specific). Filtering based on all those parameters are available. Moreover, using this platform, users can submit new entries and complete and/or correct the existing ones. 

## Inclusion criteria
This catalog only includes those data repositories that:
- Over 500 patients (unless the dataset is focused on the pediatric population or rare diseases)
- Contain both Next-Generation sequencing genotype and phenotype data of the same patients. 
- Include at least 100 recorded clinical variables per patient
- Include Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data as part of their genomic data content
- The dataset has to be accessible through a website or via a way of collaboration with investigators.
