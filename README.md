The `biobankCatalog-shiny` R Shiny app provides a biobank catalog, containing the country where the data was collected, the number of patients present in the biobank, the number of samples collected, the type of phenotypic data (electronic health records -EHR-, questionnaires, clinical notes), the type of genomic data (SNP array, whole genome sequencing data -WGS -, whole exome sequencing data -WES- ) and the disease focus (general or disease specific). Filtering based on all those parameters are available. Moreover, we provide a platform to submit new entries and complete and/or correct the existing ones.
