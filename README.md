# geno-pheno-CatalogShiny

`geno-pheno-Catalog-shiny` is an R Shiny app developed to provide a dynamic online catalog with datasets containing both, genomic sequencing and clinical data for the same patients. 

## What is this repository for?

The `geno-pheno-Catalog-shiny` R Shiny app provides a catalog, containing the country where the data was collected, the number of patients present in the dataset, the number of samples collected, the type of phenotypic data (electronic health records -EHR-, questionnaires, clinical notes), the type of genomic data (at least one of the following types of Next Generation Sequencing -NGS- only: whole genome sequencing -WGS-, whole exome sequencing data -WES-) and the disease focus (general or disease specific). Filtering based on all those parameters is available. Users can submit new entries and complete and/or correct the existing ones. 

## Inclusion criteria
This catalog only includes those data repositories that comply with the following:
1. Over 500 human subjects
2. Contain both genotype and phenotype data for **the same subjects**
3. Include WGS and/or WES data as part of the genomic data content
4. Include at least 100 recorded phenotypic variables per subject
5. The dataset has to be accessible through a website or by collaboration with investigators

All five criteria must be met for a dataset to be considered. 

## On line
The on line version of the geno-pheno-Catalog-shiny shiny app is available at:
